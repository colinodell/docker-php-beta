# PHP Beta Docker Images

This repository is a fork of https://github.com/docker-library/php's 7.2 directory, but modified to install PHP 7.3 pre-release versions instead.

## Disclaimer

These Docker images should never be used in production. I can't guarantee that these have been compiled correctly (I mean, yeah they compiled, but I could have missed something important).  By using these images you accept all risk and agree to not hold me liable for anything that goes wrong.
